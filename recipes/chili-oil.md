Chili Oil
=========

* .75 cups of crushed red pepper
* 1 cup oil with high smoke point (Canola, Grapeseed, Vegetable, etc)

Spices
------

* .5 tablespoon sichuan peppercorn
* 5 cloves of garlic
* 1 inch ginger
* 2 bay leaves
* 3 star anise
* 1 stick of cinnamon
* 2-3 scallion whites
* 4-6 cloves
* .25 teaspoon cumin seeds
* .25 teaspoon fennel seeds
* 2 cardamom seeds
 
Set Aside
---------

* .25 cups of crushed red pepper (more for spicier chili oil)
* 1 tablespoon toasted sesame
* .5-1 tablespoon crushed sichuan peppercorn (more peppercorn=more numbing)
* 1 teaspoon salt

Instructions
------------

1.  Put everything in the spices section in the oil (preferably in chessecloth, 
    or a metal strainer), heat the oil over medium low heat for 30 minutes. 
    This infuses the oil with flavor. Oil should smell very aromatic by the end of this.

2.  Remove all spices from the oil, leave oil in pot.

3.  Place .5 cups of crushed red pepper in a bowl. 

4.  Heat the oil at medium-high heat until slightly smoky, then immediately pour half the oil
    in bowl with red pepper. You can estimate the oil temperature by throwing sichuan peppercorns 
    into the oil, hot enough oil should make the peppercorn 'pop' immediately. 

    If the oil overheats a lot of the aromatic component in the oil is lost. 
    Pouring overheated oil into the red pepper will 'fry' it, and the resulting chili
    oil will not be very spicy. If you have overheated the oil, toss the red pepper flakes
    in some soy sauce. The moisture will prevent them from 'frying'. If the oil isn't hot
    enough the red pepper flakes will be chewy instead of crunchy. 

5.  Wait 5 minutes.  

6.  Add all the set aside ingredients to the mixture, pour the left over half of the oil.
