    "contact_tracing": "Students who reside off-campus and test positive for COVID-19 will be called by a public health representative, which is the typical process for all people living in Minnesota who test positive. During that call, students should expect public health officials will assess their individual living situation and provide appropriate instructions for the person who tested positive, their roommates and any close contacts about self-isolation (for the person who tested positive) and how to limit use of shared spaces to best protect the health of roommates and close contacts.",
    "self_reporting": "If you develop COVID-19 symptoms or are concerned that you may have been exposed, complete a COVID Care form and call the OMC triage line at 507-292-7266 (or call your personal health care provider). The COVID Care Team is ready to support you as soon as you complete the form."
