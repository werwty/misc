We recommend you review the privacy practices and policies of all non-ASU service providers.\r\n\r\nInformation ASU Collects from Users and How We Use it\r\nASU collects information actively provided by Users. We may also collect information about the computers, mobile devices, or other devices you use to access ASU\u2019s websites and technology network, such as IP address, unique device identifiers, browser types, browser languages, web pages visited, network software access, referring web pages, date, time, and duration of activity, passwords, and accounts accessed, volume of data storage and transfers, and locations of User devices when connected to ASU\u2019s websites and technology network.

ASU may also use information collected from you for analysis and statistical purposes consistent with ASU\u2019s Charter and Mission.\r\n\r\nCookies\r\nCookies are small files that are stored on your computing devices. We use cookies to understand and save your preferences for future visits and compile aggregate data about network traffic and network interaction so that we can offer better network experiences and tools in the future. Cookies may be set by organizations other than ASU. Because the cookie policies of these third party service providers may change over time, you should review their policies by visiting their privacy policies directly. We also use targeting and advertising cookies, which may be set by ASU or by third parties. Users may disable cookies through their individual browser options. However, if you do not accept cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of our websites or technology network.\r\n\r\nThe following describes the types of cookies ASU uses on our websites:\r\n\r\nRequired or Strictly Necessary Cookies. These cookies are essential for our websites to operate correctly and to provide you with requested services. For example, we use cookies to authenticate you, so when you log on to ASU websites, we know who you are.\r\n\r\nFunctionality Cookies. We use functionality cookies to enhance website features, such as videos and live chat, and for personalization, such as storing your preferences (e.g. username and language selection). Functionality cookies may be set by ASU or by third parties whose services we have added to our websites. If you do not allow these cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of our websites or technology network, and some website may not work properly.\r\n\r\nSocial Media Cookies. Social media cookies may be set by third parties such as YouTube and Facebook to collect information about your social media usage.\r\n\r\nAnalytics Cookies. Analytics cookies collect information about your use of our websites and technology network, and help us improve the way it works. For example, analytics cookies identify the most frequently visited pages, record any difficulties you have, and show whether our advertising is effective. This allows us to see the overall patterns of usage, rather than the usage of a single person. We use the information to analyze the websites' traffic.\r\n\r\nTargeting/Advertising Cookies. We use targeting/advertising cookies to create profiles and personalize content. We may use third party products, such as Google Analytics, to market ASU\u2019s services to you on third party websites. For example, if you visit ASU websites, you may then see advertisements for ASU on other websites.\r\n\r\nYou can learn more about cookies and their functions generally by visiting an information website such as allaboutcookies.org.\r\n\r\nDo Not Track Signals. Some web browsers have a Do Not Track (DNT) feature that tells websites that users do not want to have their online activity tracked.\r\n\r\nAlternatives to Website Transactions\r\nIf you prefer not to provide information to ASU through our websites or technology network, you may contact the ASU administrative unit responsible for the service to learn about available options.\r\n\r\nDisclosure of Information\r\nASU does not disclose confidential information we collect online to individuals or entities not affiliated with ASU, except in the limited circumstances described below.

ASU may be required to disclose confidential information pursuant to a valid court order or lawfully issued and served subpoena, search warrant, or other legal order. In addition, ASU may disclose confidential information to law enforcement if ASU believes that disclosure is necessary to protect ASU, to protect the health or safety of individuals, or if law enforcement believes that ASU\u2019s resources have been used in the commission of a crime.\r\n\r\nContractors.
