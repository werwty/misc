To run the code for Q2:

`python3 bzhang28_HW2_Q2.py`


A file named IL_employee_salary.csv is expected to be present in the same directory. 

The python libraries `matplotlib` `numpy` are expected to be present. 
For plots to show up a (matplotlib backend)[https://matplotlib.org/faq/usage_faq.html#what-is-a-backend] is expected
to be present. 

If no backend is present, you can install jupyter notebook, and run the attached bzhang28_HW2_Q2.ipynb to see the plots.

One way to do so is to run with (poetry)[https://python-poetry.org/docs/]:

```
# install dependencies
poetry install

# use the virtualenv
poetry shell

# start up the notebook
jupyter notebook
```
