Health & Wellness may begin the close contact notifications of immediate UNH community members. A close contact is defined as being within 6 feet of an infected individual for at least 10-15 minutes, regardless of mask use. The N.H. Department of Health and Human Services will also be notified and they will complete the contract tracing effort. Close contacts require 14 days of self-quarantine. Self-quarantine is recommended to be completed at your permanent home, but there will be limited quarantine housing available on campus.",
