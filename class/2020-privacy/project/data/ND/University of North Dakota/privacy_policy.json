Notice\n\nVEOCI notifies Data Subjects covered by this Choice Privacy Shield Policy about its data practices regarding Personal Data received by VEOCI in the U.S. from European Union member countries and Switzerland in reliance on the respective Privacy Shield framework, including the types of Personal Data it collects about them, the purposes for which it collects and uses such Personal Data, the types of third parties to which it discloses such Personal Data and the purposes for which it does so, the rights of Data Subjects to access their Personal Data, the choices and means that VEOCI offers for limiting its use and disclosure of such Personal Data, how VEOCI\u2019s obligations under the Privacy Shield are enforced, and how Data Subjects can contact VEOCI with any inquiries or complaints.\n\n\u200d2. Choice\n\nIf Personal Data covered by this Privacy Shield Policy is to be used for a new purpose that is materially different from that for which the Personal Data was originally collected or subsequently authorized, or is to be disclosed to a non-agent third party, VEOCI will provide Data Subjects with an opportunity to choose whether to have their Personal Data so used or disclosed. Requests to opt out of such uses or disclosures of Personal Data should be sent to: security-team@veoci.com.\n\nIf Sensitive Personal Data covered by this Privacy Shield Policy is to be used for a new purpose that is different from that for which the Personal Data was originally collected or subsequently authorized, or is to be disclosed to a third party, VEOCI will obtain the Data Subject\u2019s explicit consent prior to such use or disclosure.\n\n\u200d3. Disclosure and Accountability for Onward Transfer of Personal Data\n\nVEOCI may be forced to disclose an individual's personal information when compelled by a request made by a recognized public authority or where required to meet national security and or law enforcement requirements.\n\n\u200bIn the event we transfer Personal Data covered by this Privacy Shield Policy to a third party acting as a controller, we will do so consistent with any notice provided to Data Subjects and any consent they have given, and only if the third party has given us contractual assurances that it will (i) process the Personal Data for limited and specified purposes consistent with any consent provided by the Data Subjects, (ii) provide at least the same level of protection as is required by the Privacy Shield Principles and notify us if it makes a determination that it cannot do so; and (iii) cease processing of the Personal Data or take other reasonable and appropriate steps to remediate if it makes such a determination. If VEOCI has knowledge that a third party acting as a controller is processing Personal Data covered by this Privacy Shield Policy in a way that is contrary to the Privacy Shield Principles, VEOCI will take reasonable steps to prevent or stop such processing.\n\n\u200bWith respect to our agents, we will transfer only the Personal Data covered by this Privacy Shield Policy needed for an agent to deliver to VEOCI the requested product or service.

Upon receiving notice from an agent that it can no longer meet its obligation to provide the same level of protection as is required by the Privacy Shield Principles, we will take reasonable and appropriate steps to stop and remediate unauthorized processing.  \n\nVEOCI remains liable under the Privacy Shield Principles if an agent processes Personal Data covered by this Privacy Shield Policy in a manner inconsistent with the Principles, except where VEOCI is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.\n\n\u200d4.

Requests for access, correction, amendment, or deletion should be sent to: security-team@veoci.com.\n\n\u200d7.
