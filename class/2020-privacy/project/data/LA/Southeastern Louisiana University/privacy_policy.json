            "policy_text": "COMMITMENT TO PRIVACY\r\nSoutheastern Louisiana University is committed to maintaining the privacy and security of any collected confidential or highly sensitive personal information. The privacy statement has been adopted to address the collection, use, and dissemination of personal information by Southeastern. This statement is subject to change over time, as the technologies utilized to provide services via the Internet continue to develop and evolve. Despite changes in technology, any alterations to this statement will not affect the University\u2019s commitment to privacy.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPRIVACY STATEMENT\r\nThis policy applies to all information digitally collected by or submitted to Southeastern. Southeastern receives information via two primary methods:\r\n\r\nInformation collected automatically via websites\r\nInformation voluntarily provided by the user in order to receive information and/or services (via web forms and email).\r\n\r\nINFORMATION COLLECTION\r\n\r\nAUTOMATIC COLLECTION\r\nIf a user has not taken specific steps to anonymize their personal web traffic (e.g. apply mechanisms such as the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on that disable the collection of data for analytical purposes), official Southeastern websites may collect certain information automatically. This information includes, but is not limited to:\r\n\r\nUser\u2019s Internet protocol (IP) address\r\nInternet service provider\r\nOperating system\r\nThe time and date of the visit\r\nBrowser\r\nThe site from which the user visited\r\nCookie information (if applicable)\r\n\r\nAny information collected automatically is not associated with any other information held by Southeastern (i.e. not linked with information voluntarily provided to Southeastern) unless Southeastern is required to do so by law.\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLUNTARY SUBMISSION\r\nIn order to provide information and/or services, Southeastern may request users to provide personal data, some of which may be personally identifiable information. Information such as name, date of birth, email address, etc. can be collected via voluntary submission of an email or web form to a Southeastern entity.\r\n\r\n\r\nINFORMATION USE\r\nWebsite information that is gathered automatically is utilized to improve the understanding of how Southeastern-provided websites are being leveraged by the user community. For example, some Southeastern websites use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. Google Analytics uses \u201ccookies\u201d (i.e. files used to track website activity) to determine how users navigate Southeastern sites. Google uses this cookie data for various purposes, including the evaluation of website use, reports on website activity, and other services. Please visit the following pages for more information on Google Analytics\u2019 terms of use and Google\u2019s privacy practices.\r\n\r\nAny information submitted to Southeastern voluntarily in order to receive services and/or information will only be utilized to conduct official university business. Southeastern may disseminate voluntarily submitted information to third parties and offices/departments within Southeastern to the extent necessary in order to provide the requested services and/or information. Southeastern may also disseminate such information if required by applicable law-enforcement agencies.\r\n\r\nSoutheastern will not disclose any information submitted voluntarily for reasons other than mentioned above, without clear notice and the opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such uses. Southeastern will never sell or trade voluntarily submitted information to other entities unless a prior consent has been obtained and/or such information is being shared in response to a subpoena, court order, or legal process.\r\n\r\nThere is no legal requirement for a user to provide any information to Southeastern. However, without certain information, Southeastern websites and services may not function as intended and features may be inaccessible.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nUSE OF COOKIES\r\nSome Southeastern websites use cookies (beyond cookies utilized by Google Analytics), which enable Southeastern to further tailor its web services to the needs of the user community. Cookie data assists the University in improving both web content and distribution. Users have the right to refuse the use of cookies by implementing technical configurations in their web browsers; however, functionalities of certain sites may be impacted if such configurations are implemented.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTERNAL LINKS\r\nSome Southeastern sites may contain links to external websites not owned by, or officially affiliated with, Southeastern in any way. If a user decides to navigate to external links, he/she will leave the Southeastern website and thus, the University is not responsible for privacy practices or the content of such websites. Navigating to external links is done at the user\u2019s own risk and users should be aware that Southeastern\u2019s policies no longer apply. Southeastern recommends that users review the privacy policy and applicable terms of all sites they visit.\r\n\r\n\r\nDATA SECURITY\r\nSoutheastern implements stringent security measures wherever possible to promote confidentiality, integrity, and availability of any information in the possession of the University. Southeastern websites that allow users to submit information voluntarily utilize encryption to prevent third-parties from viewing the submitted data. Personal information voluntarily submitted via email cannot leverage encryption in most cases, and thus email is not a mechanism that Southeastern will recommend for submitting confidential and/or personal data. Users that submit unsolicited confidential and/or personal information via email must do so at their own risk.\r\n\r\nWhile the security of user data is of the utmost importance to Southeastern, due to the nature of Internet communications, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be completely secure. Any information transmitted to Southeastern by the user is done so at the user\u2019s own risk. Once the information is received by Southeastern, the University will make every effort to ensure the security of data on Southeastern\u2019s systems.",
