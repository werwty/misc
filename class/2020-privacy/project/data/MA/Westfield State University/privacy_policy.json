Likewise, the City of Westfield\r\nPublic Health Department will notify the University if they become aware that a member of the\r\nUniversity community has tested positive so that the University can take immediate action to isolate\r\nthe affected individual if necessary and assist with contact tracing.\r\nAccording to the City of Westfield Public Health Department, the University may be called upon to\r\nprovide data if available (e.g.- logs on who visited a particular office on a certain date) and will also be\r\nasked to keep track of data, including the number of students in isolation/quarantine. The University\r\nplans to have a team of trained staff ready to assist as needed with contact tracing and data collection.\r\nIn preparation for this work, the staff will enroll in a free online contact training course offered by Johns\r\nHopkins/Coursera, and the staff in SHS plans to take this training course as well",
