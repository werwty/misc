    "contact_tracing": "  \n    You will be contacted by the Raleigh County Health Department and the Dean of Students Office and provided isolation guidelines, medical guidance and begin contact tracing efforts. \nPlease be prepared to provide accurate information for the contact tracing process so we can work quickly to notify close contacts (those who have been within 6 feet of you for more than 15 minutes) and mitigate further spread of COVID-19. It may help to review your calendar and travel to remember locations and close contacts. If it helps, write this down so you can give the most accurate picture to those conducting the contact tracing process.\nWe know that during this time you may tell those who are determined to be close contacts that you have tested positive for COVID-19. Those people may very well receive information to quarantine as a result of the contact tracing process, but we ask that you and those close contacts allow time for us to accurately conduct contact tracing and alert them on their next steps.",
    "self_reporting": "\n\nPlease note: For the required WVU baseline COVID-19 test, you may see your positive COVID-19 test result through the QLab app prior to this notification. If you receive a positive result prior to being notified by a student notification email, you are required to let the University know you have tested positive for COVID-19 at TechStudentLife@mail.wvu.edu"
