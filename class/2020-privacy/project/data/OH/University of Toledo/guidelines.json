    "contact_tracing": "\nThe Toledo-Lucas County Health Department is handling contact tracing for any cases connected to the University.\n\nIndividuals who were in close contact (within 6 feet) for a prolonged period of time (15 minutes or more) with someone who tested positive for COVID-19 will need to take precautionary measures, such as 14-day quarantine. The CDC website has additional guidance of what constitutes an exposure and what steps an individual should take following an exposure.\n\nUniversity representatives will provide the health department with information for contact tracing if permissible or required by law. Without identifying the ill individual, University faculty or staff may notify specific students and others that a person with whom they were in contact over the past 14 days has tested positive and that they should take appropriate cautionary measures.",
    "self_reporting": "\nIn the event that a student, faculty member or staff member informs a University employee they have tested positive for COVID-19 or have been diagnosed as a probable case, that employee should instruct the individual to review the CDC guidance on self-isolation and symptom monitoring, and report the disclosure to the appropriate office, depending on whether the ill individual is a student, faculty member, staff member or UTMC employee.",
