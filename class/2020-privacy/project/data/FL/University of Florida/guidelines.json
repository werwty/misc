The COVID-19 pandemic is a communicable disease of public health significance.\r\n\r\nApart from the direct uses of test results described on this website, access to an individual\u2019s test sample and results will be held in a confidential manner by UF Health in a secure database and/or by the State of Florida Department of Health.\r\n\r\nHow Contact Tracing Works\r\nA person with a suspected or confirmed infection is identified.\r\nPublic health staff work with the person to help them recall everyone with whom they have had close contact during the timeframe while they may have been infectious.\r\nPublic health staff then warn these exposed individuals (contacts) of their potential exposure as rapidly and as sensitively as possible.",
