    "app": "IU Health coronavirus screening app\r\nIU Health has launched a free, COVID-19 virtual clinic screening option for all individuals in Indiana, regardless of age. The clinic will screen patients from home via the IU Health Virtual Visit app, potentially eliminating the need to visit physician offices, urgent cares, or emergency departments. They can recommend and facilitate appropriate pathways for care, and provide direct access and communication with local hospitals as medically appropriate.",
    "contact_tracing": "How IU is using contact tracing to address COVID-19\r\nThe health experts who lead Indiana University's Medical Response Team believe that a robust system of contact tracing is key to the safe return of students and employees to IU campuses across the state this fall.\r\n\r\nAugust 25, 2020 at 8:30 AM\r\nContact tracing helps isolate cases and identifies close contacts of individuals who have tested positive for a disease in order to stop the chain of transmission. For COVID-19, close contacts are defined as someone who has been within 6 feet of an infected person for more than 15 minutes. Read more about contact tracing at IU.",
    "self_reporting": "If a student has had a test but does not yet have results, they should bring a hard copy or digital verification of taking the test. If a student has made a good-faith effort to have a test before arriving on campus, but was unable to because of lack of tests in their area, etc., they should use the results form to report that."
